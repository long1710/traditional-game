Chess pure logic 
  This is the "Console" version of chess game that I replicate, It has some basic features: 
    - Chess : 
      + Movement
      + Attack ( or Capture) with point calculated
      + King capture = game over
    - Player
      + name of player number of win/lose/draw and score obtains in game
